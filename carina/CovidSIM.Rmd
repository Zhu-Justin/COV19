# Estimation of the impact by contact reduction 
# This section allows to estimate the impact of contact reduction based on a number of parameters. The parameter for R0 can be suggested by default in the interface, but it should be allowed to be changed. With those parameters, the formula calculates the impact on the transmission by applying contact reduction.
